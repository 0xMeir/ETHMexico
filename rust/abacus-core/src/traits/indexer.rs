//! An Indexer provides a common interface for bubbling up chain-specific
//! event-data to another entity (e.g. a `ContractSync`). For example, the only
//! way to retrieve data such as the chain's latest block number or a list of
//! checkpoints/messages emitted within a certain block range by calling out to a
//! chain-specific library and provider (e.g. ethers::provider). A
//! chain-specific outbox or inbox should implement one or both of the Indexer
//! traits (CommonIndexer or OutboxIndexer) to provide an common interface which
//! other entities can retrieve this chain-specific info.
